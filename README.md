## ðŸš€ Project structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ media/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reuse/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components in `src/components/`.

Any static assets can be placed in the `public/` directory. Put images referenced by content in `media/`.

## External content

The external-content folder serves as a grafting point for content residing outside the docs-next repo.

To get up and running on the current code:

1. Clone superoffice-docs and contribution into this folder.
2. Add "YamlMime: SubCategory" on line 2 of contribution/index.yml. (only until the repo's we're pulling in become compliant)

To bring in more of the external content when building the site:

1. Define collections from this external content in src/content.config.ts
2. Add route-building and layout for each collection in src/pages.
